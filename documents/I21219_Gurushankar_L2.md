### 2.2 Context Architecture - State Management Strategy

The application uses a hierarchical context architecture to manage complex state efficiently:

```
Root Level: UnifiedAuthContext (User Identity & Permissions)
    │
    ├─→ ProductContext (500+ Products Management)
    │     │
    │     └─→ CategoryContext (Multi-dimensional Filtering)
    │
    ├─→ CartContext (Shopping Cart + Order Management)
    │     │
    │     └─→ PaymentContext (Payment Processing & Verification)
    │
    ├─→ NotificationContext (Real-time User & Admin Notifications)
    │
    ├─→ LanguageContext (English + Tamil i18n)
    │
    └─→ AccessibilityContext (Font Size, Keyboard Nav, Screen Readers)
```

**Key Benefits of This Architecture:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each context handles one domain
- **Performance**: Components subscribe only to relevant contexts
- **Maintainability**: Changes isolated to specific contexts
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new contexts without affecting existing ones

### 5.3 Effective Prompting Techniques Learned

**1. Context-Rich Prompting**
Instead of: "Create a cart component"

Effective Approach:
"Create a React shopping cart component for a bridal jewelry e-commerce platform. Requirements:
- Support both rental and purchase items
- Calculate GST (5% for rental, 18% for sale)
- Persist to localStorage
- Show item thumbnails and details
- Update quantities
- Display running total
- Handle empty state
- Use Iron Man Mark 3 theme colors"

**2. Iterative Refinement**
Start broad → Get initial solution → Refine specific aspects

Example progression:
- "Create authentication system"
- → "Add role-based access (Admin/User)"
- → "Add localStorage persistence"
- → "Add logout cleanup"
- → "Add session expiry handling"

**3. Specific Constraints**
"Use React 18 hooks"
"Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines"
"Optimize for mobile-first responsive design"
"Implement without external state management libraries"

**4. Learning-Oriented Questions**
Not just "Fix this error" but:

### 5.7 AI Prompting Techniques & Context-Rich Development

This project served as a masterclass in **effective AI prompting** and demonstrated how proper AI collaboration transforms development efficiency. Through 8 weeks of intensive work, several critical prompting patterns emerged.

#### Evolution of Prompting Skills

**Week 1: Basic Prompts** (Low Effectiveness)
```
Initial Approach:
"Create a shopping cart"
"Make a login page"
"Add products to database"

Problems:
• Vague requirements led to generic solutions
• Constant back-and-forth for clarifications
• Needed multiple iterations to get desired result
• AI couldn't understand project context
```

**Week 4: Context-Rich Prompts** (High Effectiveness)
```
Evolved Approach:
"Create a React shopping cart component for SundariSaj Bridal 
Collection e-commerce platform with these specific requirements:

Business Context:
- Bridal jewelry rental + purchase options
- Indian GST compliance (5% rental, 18% sale)
- Target: Homemakers running small businesses

Technical Requirements:
- React 18 with Context API for state
- localStorage persistence for offline capability
- Iron Man Mark 3 theme colors (#6b0f0f, #b68f40)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility

Features Needed:
1. Add items with duplicate prevention (increment quantity)
2. Support both rental and purchase item types
3. Calculate GST separately for each item type
4. Display running total with tax breakdown
5. Persist to localStorage on every change
6. Handle empty cart state gracefully
7. Integration with existing ProductContext

Please provide component with proper error handling and 
performance optimization using React.memo where appropriate."

Results:
✓ 90% accurate on first generation
✓ Minimal iterations needed
✓ Properly integrated with existing code
✓ Followed project patterns and conventions
```

#### Core Prompting Techniques Mastered

**1. Context Layering Technique**

Build prompts with multiple context layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Layer 1: Project Context                 │
│  "Working on SundariSaj Bridal Collection,     │
│   an e-commerce platform for jewelry rental"    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Layer 2: Business Context                │
│  "Target users: Homemakers with minimal         │
│   technical knowledge. Cultural focus:           │
│   South Indian bridal jewelry traditions"        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Layer 3: Technical Context               │
│  "Using React 18, Context API, localStorage.    │
│   Existing: ProductContext, CartContext,         │
│   AuthContext. Theme: Iron Man Mark 3"           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Layer 4: Specific Requirement            │
│  "Need to add GST calculation feature with      │
│   5% for rental items and 18% for sale items"   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Application:**
When implementing the refund system, this layered approach helped AI understand:
- **Why** refunds needed verification (homemaker business trust)
- **What** data to collect (proof images, reason, order history)
- **How** to integrate (existing order lifecycle, admin dashboard)
- **Constraints** (prevent duplicate refunds, sales report impact)

**2. Iterative Refinement Pattern**

Start broad, then progressively add detail:

```
Iteration 1: "Create user dashboard"
    ↓ [AI provides basic structure]
    
Iteration 2: "Add order history with status timeline"
    ↓ [AI adds order list with basic timeline]
    
Iteration 3: "Include payment proof status in order cards"
    ↓ [AI integrates payment information]
    
Iteration 4: "Add review submission for delivered orders"
    ↓ [AI adds review capability with status check]
    
Iteration 5: "Support image/video upload in reviews"
    ↓ [Complete feature with media handling]
```

**Key Insight**: Each iteration builds on previous context, allowing AI to maintain consistency while adding complexity.

**3. Constraint-Driven Prompting**

Explicitly state what you DON'T want:

```
Effective Prompt Structure:

"Create PDF invoice generation system.

✓ DO:
- Use jsPDF library
- Include itemized product list
- Calculate GST per item (5% rental, 18% sale)
- Professional formatting with company branding
- Auto-download on order confirmation

✗ DON'T:
- Use external PDF services (must be client-side)
- Require server-side processing
- Include any backend dependencies
- Make network requests
- Store PDFs on server (just download)

MUST HANDLE:
- Missing or null order data gracefully
- Invalid product information
- Undefined customer details
- Zero-item orders"
```

**Result**: This prevented the "Type of text must be string or Array" error that would have occurred with unconstrained generation.

**4. Learning-Oriented Prompting**

Transform AI from code generator to teacher:

```
Instead of: "Fix this error"

Use: "I'm getting this error: [error details]

Before providing the fix, please:
1. Explain WHY this error occurs
2. What are the underlying causes?
3. What are best practices to prevent this in future?
4. Then provide the solution with explanation

This is a learning opportunity for my frontend journey."
```

**Real Example - localStorage Caching Issue:**

**Question to AI:**
"Products aren't updating after I modified products.json. The app still shows old data. Why does this happen in React applications with localStorage, and what's the proper solution?"

**AI Response Framework:**
1. **Explanation**: localStorage persists data across sessions; Context prioritizes cached data
2. **Root Cause**: ProductContext loading from localStorage before checking JSON
3. **Best Practice**: Version keys for cache invalidation
4. **Solution**: Change localStorage key or prioritize JSON over cache
5. **Prevention**: Implement cache versioning strategy

**Impact**: Understood caching patterns deeply, not just fixed one bug.

**5. Architectural Prompting**

Get AI help with design decisions, not just implementation:

```
"I need to manage complex state for an e-commerce platform:
- User authentication (3 roles)
- Product catalog (500+ items with filtering)
- Shopping cart with persistence
- Order lifecycle (9 status transitions)
- Real-time notifications
- Multi-language support
- Accessibility preferences

Question: Should I use:
A) Redux for centralized state
B) Multiple React Contexts
C) Zustand/Jotai lightweight libraries
D) Component state with prop drilling

Consider:
- Team has no Redux experience (just me learning React)
- Need to avoid over-engineering
- Performance is important
- Easy to understand for future maintenance
- No budget for paid state management services

Please compare approaches with pros/cons for my specific context."
```

**AI Guidance Received:**
- Recommended Context API for this scale
- Explained when Redux becomes necessary (>1000 actions)
- Suggested context hierarchy strategy
- Warned about performance pitfalls
- Provided migration path if needed later

**Decision Made**: Multiple Contexts - proved correct for project scale.

#### Context-Rich Development Methodology

**Progressive Context Building:**

```
Week 1: Foundation Context
    ├─→ "Building bridal jewelry rental platform"
    └─→ AI learns: E-commerce basics, catalog, cart

Week 2-3: Business Context Addition
    ├─→ "Target: Homemakers, minimal investment model"
    ├─→ "Indian market, GST compliance required"
    └─→ AI learns: Business logic, tax rules, cultural aspects

Week 4-5: Technical Context Expansion
    ├─→ "Using React 18, Context API, 8 contexts"
    ├─→ "Iron Man theme, Tamil language support"
    └─→ AI learns: Architecture, integration patterns, constraints

Week 6-7: Advanced Feature Context
    ├─→ "Admin workflow, payment verification, reviews"
    ├─→ "Refund management with verification phases"
    └─→ AI learns: Complex workflows, user roles, security

Week 8: Production Context
    ├─→ "Deploying to Vercel, security hardening"
    ├─→ "Performance optimization, WCAG compliance"
    └─→ AI learns: Production concerns, optimization, best practices
```

**Key Insight**: By Week 8, AI had comprehensive project context. Could generate features that correctly integrated with existing patterns without extensive instruction.

#### Real-World Prompting Examples

**Challenge 1: Multi-Angle Image Zoom**

**Initial Prompt (Week 2):**
"Add image zoom to product page"

**Result:** Basic single-image zoom, didn't match requirements

**Refined Prompt (Week 5):**
"Implement Amazon-style product image gallery for bridal jewelry with:

Context: Customers need to inspect jewelry details closely
Use Case: Multiple angles (front, side, detail, worn)
User Flow: 
1. Thumbnail strip at bottom showing 4-8 images per product
2. Main image viewer above thumbnails
3. Click thumbnail → changes main image
4. Click main image → full-screen zoom overlay
5. Arrow navigation in full-screen
6. Swipe gestures for mobile
7. ESC or click outside to close

Technical:
- Lazy load images (not all at once)
- WebP format with JPG fallback
- Maintain aspect ratio
- Smooth transitions (0.3s)
- Keyboard accessible (Tab, Enter, Arrows, ESC)

Integration:
- Product object has images array: ['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', ...]
- Works with existing ProductContext
- Mobile-responsive (touch events)

Performance:
- Only load main image initially
- Load thumbnails on scroll into view
- Preload next/prev in full-screen mode"

**Result:** Perfect implementation, matched industry standards

**Challenge 2: GST Calculation System**

**Context-Rich Prompt:**
"Implement Indian GST calculation for SundariSaj platform.

Business Regulation:
India GST Act requirements:
- Rental services: 5% GST (2.5% SGST + 2.5% CGST)
- Sale of goods: 18% GST (9% SGST + 9% CGST)

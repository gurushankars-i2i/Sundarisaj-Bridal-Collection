# Current Status Summary - Sundarisaj Bridal Collection

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed `no-undef` Error in AdminAccountDeletionManager.js
- **Problem**: `'supabase' is not defined` error on line 29:43
- **Solution**: Removed direct `supabase` import and updated `loadDeletedUsers()` function to use `adminService.getAllUsers()` instead of direct supabase calls
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Fixed Import Error in AccountDeletionModal.js
- **Problem**: `export 'useAuth' was not found` error
- **Solution**: Changed import from `useAuth` to `useSupabaseAuth` and updated all references
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## 🔧 Current System Status

### User Role Distinction
The application already has proper role-based access control:

1. **Admin Users** (`role: 'admin'`):
   - Access to `/admin` route (protected with `allowedRoles={['admin']}`)
   - Full admin dashboard with order management, product management, and account deletion management
   - Can manage all users, orders, and system settings

2. **Staff Users** (`role: 'staff'`):
   - Access to user features plus some admin capabilities
   - Can access cart, profile, and user dashboard

3. **Regular Users** (`role: 'user'`):
   - Standard e-commerce user access
   - Can browse products, manage cart, view profile, and place orders

### Admin Credentials
Based on the database setup (`database/15-add-test-users.sql`), the following admin users are available:

**Primary Admin Users:**
- **Email**: `admin@bridal.com`
- **Email**: `priya.sharma@gmail.com` 
- **Email**: `rajesh.kumar@gmail.com`

**Note**: These users need to be registered with Supabase Auth and have their emails confirmed. The passwords are not stored in the database for security reasons.

## 📋 Pending Tasks for User

### 1. Database Setup (Manual Steps Required)
You need to run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Add test users to database
-- Run: database/15-add-test-users.sql

-- 2. Create account deletion functions
-- Run: database/16-account-deletion-functions.sql
```

### 2. Email Confirmation Setup
To enable login for test users, you need to:

**Option A: Disable Email Confirmation (Recommended for Testing)**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Uncheck "Enable email confirmations"
3. Save changes

**Option B: Manually Confirm Emails**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find each test user and click "Confirm" button
3. Repeat for all test users

### 3. Test User Registration (If Needed)
If you need to register users with Supabase Auth, run:
```bash
node scripts/register-test-users.js
```

## 🗑️ Test Options Removal

The user requested: *"I don't want to see the test-user-lifecycle option at all. From now on I will test application with supabase itself"*

**Status**: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE
- No `test-user-lifecycle` component exists in the application
- All test scripts are in the `scripts/` directory and are not part of the main application UI
- The application only shows production features in the UI

4. **Deletion Request**: 7-day grace period before permanent deletion
5. **Admin Management**: Admins can manage all deletion requests and recover accounts

### User Access:

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL scripts** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Configure email confirmation** settings in Supabase Dashboard
3. **Test login** with admin credentials
4. **Deploy the application** to your preferred hosting platform

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Login Still Doesn't Work:
1. Check if users exist in Supabase Auth (Authentication → Users)
2. Verify email confirmation status
3. Check if users exist in the custom `users` table
4. Ensure RLS policies are properly configured

### If Account Deletion Functions Don't Work:
1. Verify that `database/16-account-deletion-functions.sql` has been executed
2. Check if the user has proper permissions
3. Verify the user exists in both Supabase Auth and custom users table

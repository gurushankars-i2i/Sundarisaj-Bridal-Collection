## ✅ **SOLUTION 1: Manual Image Collection (RECOMMENDED)**

### **Step-by-Step Process**

#### **For Each Kemp Product, Collect:**

1. **Visit the websites you mentioned**
2. **Right-click on jewelry images** and save them
3. **Rename images** according to our product IDs:
   - `kemp-necklace-6-front.jpg`
   - `kemp-necklace-6-detail.jpg`
   - `kemp-necklace-6-side.jpg`
   - `kemp-necklace-6-worn.jpg`

4. **Upload to your project**:
   - Create folder: `public/images/products/kemp/`
   - Place all images there

5. **I'll update the JSON** to reference these local images

## ✅ **SOLUTION 2: Use Unsplash/Pexels (Current Approach)**

I can use high-quality **royalty-free** images from:
- **Unsplash**: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/indian-jewelry
- **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/search/indian-bridal-jewelry/

**Pros:**
- ✅ No copyright issues
- ✅ High quality
- ✅ Can implement immediately
- ✅ Professional photography

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May not exactly match product descriptions
- ⚠️ Generic jewelry, not specific Kemp designs

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION 3: Hybrid Approach (BEST)**

1. **I'll implement with Unsplash images NOW** (so you can test the app)
2. **You collect specific images** from your suggested websites
3. **Replace images gradually** as you collect them

This way:
- ✅ App works immediately
- ✅ You can test zoom feature
- ✅ You can replace with exact images at your pace

---

## 🔍 **Implementing Zoom Feature**

I'll set up the product structure to support **multiple images per product**:

```json
{
  "id": 6,
  "name": "Ruby Kemp Stone Bridal Necklace Set",
  "images": [
    "image-url-1.jpg",  // Front view (main)
    "image-url-2.jpg",  // Detail close-up
    "image-url-3.jpg",  // Side angle
    "image-url-4.jpg"   // On model
  ],
  "image": "image-url-1.jpg"  // Primary image
}
```

The zoom feature will allow users to:
- 📸 View all angles
- 🔍 Zoom in on details
- 👁️ See intricate work clearly
- 💫 Better understand the product

## 📋 **What I Recommend RIGHT NOW**

### **Option A: Let me implement with Unsplash (5 minutes)**
- I'll find the best Kemp-style jewelry images
- Add 3-4 images per product for zoom
- You can test the feature immediately
- Replace later with your chosen images

### **Option B: You collect images first (30-60 minutes)**
- Visit the websites
- Download 3-4 images per Kemp product (5 products = 15-20 images)
- Send them to me or upload to the project
- I'll implement with your exact images

### **Option C: Hybrid (RECOMMENDED)**
- I implement with Unsplash NOW
- You collect specific images at your pace
- We replace images gradually
- App keeps working throughout

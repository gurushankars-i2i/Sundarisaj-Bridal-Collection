- **Action**: Just run the script as is

### Error: "relation does not exist"
- **Solution**: Make sure you ran the entire script from `database/08-simple-schema-setup.sql`
- **Action**: Check that all tables were created successfully

### Error: "permission denied"
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using the correct API keys
- **Action**: Verify your project is active and not paused
